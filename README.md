# Introduction

This repository/workspace is for trying things out which may or may or may not be included later in milestone projects, or projects of personal interest. <br>

I want to keep such things together to be able to easily find something if I need to look back at it, and in order not to have many repositories in my GitHub creating clutter around the headline projects.
